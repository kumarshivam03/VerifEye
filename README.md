# VerifEye

This repository contains **VerifEye**, an application designed to help users determine the veracity of a given statement. The application is built with a ReactJS frontend and a Flask backend. The backend processes the fact-checking and provides the confidence level of the provided fact, and if the fact is false, it provides a counter-narrative.
